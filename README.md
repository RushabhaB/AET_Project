## Channel Estimation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Systems

This repository contains our work done on the applications of channel estimation in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Systems for our project in the course **_EEE G641 Applied Estimation Theory_**.
The entire project has been implemented in MATLAB. To run all the codes, the following toolbox needs to be installed :

```
Communication Toolbox
```

The project builds upon the work by : \
>*[1] AHMED TOHAMY, USAMA SAYED MOHAMED,
MOHAMMAD M. ABDELLATIF, TAHA A. KHALAF1 AND MOHAMED ABDELRAHEEM Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Using Maximum a
Posteriori as a Detection Technique for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks*

We introduce the problems of channel estimation in [1] and see the impact of non-ideal CSI on the results for the proposed MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) combiner as well 
as the Majority combiner which is implemented in the fusion center.
